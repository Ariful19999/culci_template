            <h4>O</h4> <span>– Opportunity</span> <br>

            <p class="text-wrap">Those are just a few of the rewards young people gain from participating in Leos. They also happen to be the values that create the acronym of our club name.
            </p>

            <p class="text-muted">In total, more than 175,000 young people in 145 countries are proud to serve others in their local communities and to call themselves Leos. These young community leaders are friendly, active and dedicated to creating new and exciting opportunities by participating in their local Leo clubs. Social and professional connections are an additional benefit for Omega members (age 18 and older).</p>

            <h3>Leo Clubs History</h3>

            <p>Back in 1957, Graver was the coach of the Abington High School, Pennsylvania, USA, baseball team. Graver was also an active member of the Glenside, Pennsylvania, Lions Club. With fellow Lion, William Ernst, Graver talked about starting a service club for high school boys.</p>

            <p class="text-muted">“The Kiwanians had their Key Clubs and the Rotarians had their Wheel Club (since changed to Interact Clubs),” Ernst is quoted as saying in an October 7, 1976, newspaper article in “The Evening Bulletin.” So they asked their fellow Lions for support. Without hesitation, the Glenside Lions agreed that a Lions youth group was a good idea. Graver and Ernst set to work. “We needed a nucleus, a group of kids to start with,” stated Ernst. “So we got Jim’s son to come to the first meeting with his whole baseball team.” Nine sophomore, junior and senior boys joined the group of 26 baseball players. Together, the 35 teens formed a club. On December 5, 1957, the Glenside Lions presented a charter to the Abington High School Leo Club.</p>

            <p>As the world’s first Leo club, the group created the Leo acronym – Leadership, Equality, Opportunity (Equality was later changed to Experience.) And, the group chose maroon and gold – their school colors – to serve as the Leo club colors. An Idea Whose Time Had Come The Abington Leos were a singular entity until 1963. In that year, a Leo club was formed at the Tamaqua Area High School in Pennsylvania. Shortly thereafter, a former Philadelphia Lion formed a Leo club in New York. By 1964, there were 27 Leo clubs in Pennsylvania and one in New York. The circle of junior service clubs was expanding.</p>

            <p class="text-muted">In October 1967, the board of directors of Lions Clubs International adopted the Leo Club Program as an official program of the association. Open to males and females, the objective of the Leo Club Program was (and still is):”…to provide the youth of the world (with) an opportunity for development and contribution, individually and collectively, as responsible members of the local, national and international community.” In 1968, newly formed Leo clubs began sending their requests for club certification to International Headquarters.</p>

            <p>On October 17, 1969, forms requesting certification for the Abington High School Leo Club reached headquarters. On this date, the world’s original Leo club was formally recognized as a part of the international Leo program. Leo John Hebert of Baederwood, Pennsylvania, served as president of the Abington High School Leo Club. Today, the Leo Club Program is stronger than ever. Community service remains the cornerstone of the program. Like their Lion counterparts, Leo club members enjoy serving their neighbors and watching positive results unfold <br>

              <h3>Leoism in Bangladesh</h3>

              <p class="text-muted">Late Abdul Jabber Khan is the founder of Leo Clubs in Bangladesh. On 23rd August of 1973, the Leo Club of Bangladesh namely Kamalapur Leo club was established. Leo M Aawarul Haque is the founder Leo District President of District 315 Bangladesh. In the Leo District Year 1987-88 Leo District 315 bifurcated into 2 Leo Districts Namely District 315 A & 315 B. Again in the Leo District Year 1997-98, Leo District 315-B bifurcated into Leo District 315 B4. Leo Manjur Alam Manju is the founder District president of Leo District 315 B4 during 1997-98.</p>

              <p>Leoism of Bangladesh is dramatically changed in the year 1999-2000 and recognized Multiple Leo District Council 315. At present, there are 6 Leo District (315 A1, 315 A2, 315 B1, 315 B2, 315 B3, and 315 B4) under the umbrella of six Lion District with Multiple District 315.</p>

              Today, the Leo Club Program is stronger than ever. Community service remains the cornerstone of the program. Like their Lion counterparts, Leo club members enjoy serving their neighbors and watching positive results unfold.

            <h3>Who Benefits from Leo Clubs?</h3>
            <h5>Young People:</h5>

            <p class="text-wrap">Participation in Leo activities and projects helps young people prepare for the future by developing leadership, organizational and social skills. Members experience increased self-esteem and personal growth as they meet challenges and accept responsibilities.
            </p>

            <p class="text-muted">By volunteering their time and talents for the benefit of others, Leos learn firsthand the value and rewards of service. Leo club involvement can start young men and women on a lifetime of helping others.</p>

           <h5>The Sponsoring Lions Club:</h5>

            <p>By sharing in service activities, a Leo club can increase a Lions club’s effectiveness in helping others. Leo projects within the community also contribute to a Lions club’s visibility and good reputation. Working with young people can help Lions club members experience renewed interest and enthusiasm for projects and activities. If Leos are sons or daughters of Lions, club involvement becomes a “family affair”.</p>

            <h5>Who Can Be a Leo?</h5>

            <p class="text-muted">Leo club membership is open to young men and women between the ages of 12 and 30. Membership is divided into two groups, the school-based Leos are generally between the ages of 12 and 17 whereas the community-based clubs have members ages 18-30.</p>

            <p>Young people of high moral standards who wish to serve others are eligible to become Leos. School administrators, Lions, friends of Lions and community leaders can provide names of potential members. Candidates may also be recruited through public announcements.</p>

            <h5>What is the Leo-Lion Relationship?</h5>

            <p class="text-muted">The success of a Leo club depends on a close partnership with its sponsoring Lions club. The Lions’ role is to offer support, guidance and counsel while the Leos are responsible for planning and implementing their own activities, financing their projects and maintaining the smooth operation of the club. Leos have their own club officers and constitution.</p>

            <p>The Leo club advisor (a member of the sponsoring Lions club) serves as the chief liaison between the Leo and Lions clubs. Duties of the advisor include offering constructive suggestions to the Leos, reporting on their activities to the Lions club and promoting a cooperative relationship between the two clubs.</p>

            <h5>The Privileges of Leo Membership?</h5>

              <p class="text-muted">As a sponsored activity of a Lions club, Leo clubs are entitled to many services and benefits offered by Lions Clubs International. Informational and club materials include new member kits, guides for service activities, leadership aids, ideas for fundraising, club supplies and international newsletters.</p>

              <p>Leos can participate in the annual Lions Clubs International Convention, attending their own functions. Leos are also entitled to receive official awards and recognition for their achievements.</p>

              <p class="text-muted">Because of the international scope of Leo clubs, members enjoy the global identity of a worldwide organization. International programmes such as club twinning, youth exchange and youth camps enable Leos to connect with and learn from other young people around the world.</p>

              <h5>What About School-Based Clubs?</h5>

              <p>Leo clubs can be formed in state or private schools. The supervision by the sponsoring Lions club is exercised in full cooperation with the school authorities. The Leo club is subject to the regulations and policies established for all student organizations and activities. A faculty advisor, usually a member of the school’s staff or administration, serves as a liaison between the school and Leo club. The faculty advisor also works closely with the Leo club advisor.</p>

             <h5>How Do We Begin?</h5>

              <p class="text-muted">If Lions club members are interested in sponsoring a Leo club, complete the coupon to obtain an organization kit. The kit includes: <br>

                Suggestions for organizing a Leo club;</p>

              <p>1. Information brochures for prospective Leos; <br>

                2. Leo club constitution; <br>
                
                3. Handbook for Leo club advisors; <br>
                
                4. Application for Certificate of Organization; <br>
                
                5. Membership application blanks</p> 

              <h5>Leo Membership</h5>

              <p>When you join LEO’s you become a member of a worldwide organisation with more than 7000 LEO Clubs and a membership in excess of 175,000 people operating under the sponsorship of Lions Clubs in 145 nations.</p>

              <p>In Australia and Papua New Guinea there are currently over 1400 Leos who are members of 68 Leo clubs.  These Leo Clubs have proud records of Achievement in all areas of service to their local communities.  All of our clubs provide ample opportunity for their members to learn and to be involved.</p>

              <h5>How Much Time will it take?</h5>

               <h2>We will together make the world better</h2>
               <p>Every journey begins with a single step. One act of service, one encouraging word, one gift of generosity is often all it takes to bring hope where it’s needed most. Over the last 100 years, the kindness of Lions and Leos has multiplied across borders, oceans, and continents. With over 1.4 million members, we now have an opportunity to truly change our world. That’s why we’re uniting our global service around five areas of need. These Global Causes present significant challenges to humanity, and we believe it’s our turn to meet them.</p>
